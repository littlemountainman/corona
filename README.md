Open questions
=============
* Is there a way to simulate antibodies aginst the SarsV2 virus ? 

Testing
===============
* Would testing on the orf1ab polyprotein be faster or are there ways compared to using RdRP ?  
* How different is testing with the primer RdRP compared to the orf1ab ? 
* Can testing with anti bodies work, when trying to detect the virus, the test would optimally look for the anti bodies built by the immune system that "pin" to the virus' anti genes. 

Proteins 
===============

The orf1ab is the polyprotein for the Sars v2 virus.
